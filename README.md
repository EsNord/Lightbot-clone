# Lightbot-clone

Lightbot it's an educational game to help people understand basic concepts of programming.
This is a reimplementation of that same game.

You can play the original one here: https://lightbot.com/flash.html

**If you are playing the game on mobile you won't be able to input your name to submit your highscore
this is a known bug with the WebGL export on unity**

# How-To

**NOTE1: To add operations to the other function block just click on it and it'll light up, that way you know that's the active function block.**

**NOTE2: You can delete operations from a selected function block by clicking on the operation in the block, it will light up so you can press the top right "X" button to delete it**

# Level Descriptions

There are described 6 levels in the game, each level tries to "teach" a game feature:

**Level1**: You only have 2 operations available (forward and light) and 3 slots on the "Main" block.
this is a very simple level just to show a bit the game mechanics

**Level2**: This level forces you to turn in order to reach the destination so the turn operations are available now.

**Level3**: This level is the same as the previous one but the center blocks are higher and they hide the target block. This is made so to show the "Rotate board" functionality

**Level4**: The level is the same as the previous one but the target is one of the high blocks so you'll have to use the jump operation.

**Level5**: This is the same level as the 1st one but you only have 1 slot available on "Main", this forces you to use a function 

**Level6**: it forces you to loop a function block to clear the level.
